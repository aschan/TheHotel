# TheHotel

Implementation of a simple case, a test to see if I understand basic concepts and can structure my code.

## Assumptions
* The main executable, the api host, uses an IoC container in order to resolve dependencies.
* There is mapping logic in place to map incoming request objects to internal DTOs.
